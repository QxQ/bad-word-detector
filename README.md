bad-word-detector
=================

A bad word detector thats hard to outsmart

*Note that this program doesn't know any real bad words, so don't go typing in real bad words

   Type anything in, and this program will search through it for a bad word. However, this program is smarter then the average bad-word-detector. It doesn't just look for an exact match, but anything that could look like a bad word to the user. The primary purpose of this program is to prove it is possible, and to try to get people to start implementing similar programs into online chats.

   Note that this program doesn't actually have any bad words stored in it. instead it uses a fake list of bad words, so things like "brick" is a bad word, but a real bad word will actually not be detected.
   
   This program is mostly a proof of concept and wasn't actually meant to be implemented, but you can if you want. It's also not in active development anymore, so you probably won't see updates for it (unless people actually want it).

   This program, along with all the little libraries it uses are licensed under the mit lisense, unless a library says so otherwise.
	
## installation ##

its easy enough. the only dependency you need is python 3, which can be downloaded from their [website](http://python.org). then all you need to do is tell python to run the bin folder. in a linux terminal, this can be accomplished with these commands

	cd /path/to/badWordDetector
	python3 bin
