bad-word-detector
=================

a bad word detector thats hard to outsmart

*note that this program doesn't know any real bad words, so don't go typing in real bad words

   type anything in, and this program will search through it for a bad word. however, this program is smarter then the average bad-word-detector. it doesn't just look for an exact match, but anything that could look like a bad word to the user. the primary purpose of this program is to prove it is possible, and to try to get people to start implementing similar programs into online chats.

   note that this program doesn't actually have any bad words stored in it. instead it uses a fake list of bad words, so things like "brick" is a bad word, but a real bad word will actually not be detected.

   this program, along with all the little libraries it uses are licensed under the mit lisense, unless a library says so otherwise.
   

__this program is still in beta, so most of the features above, don't actually work yet.__
